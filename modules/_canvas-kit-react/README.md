# Canvas Kit React

The bundle package containing all modules of the Canvas React Kit.

> Note: By default, no fonts are included with Canvas Kit modules. To use official Canvas Kit fonts,
> install and import the `@workday/canvas-kit-react-fonts` module in addition to
> `@workday/canvas-kit-react`. The fonts files are served from the Workday CDN so this allows
> consumers to opt in to using the Workday CDN.
