# Canvas Kit Modal

A Modal component is a type of Dialog that renders a translucent overlay that prevents user
interaction with the rest of the page. A Modal will render the rest of the page inert until the
Modal is dismissed. A Modal should be used when the user needs to presented with important
information that must be interacted with before continuing interaction with the rest of the page.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @workday/canvas-kit-react
```

## Usage

### Basic

The basic behavior of a modal is to hide all content from all users that is "behind" the modal
dialog.

<ExampleCodeBlock code={Basic} />

### Without Close Icon

If you wish to remove the close icon button, you can simply omit the `Modal.CloseButton`
subcomponent. If you have a modal dialog that requires the user to accept instead of dismiss though
an escape key or clicking outside the modal, you must create a new `PopupModel` without those
behaviors and hand that model to the Modal dialog component.

### Custom Focus

By default, the Modal makes sure the first focusable element receives focus when the Modal is
opened. Most of the time, this is the `Modal.CloseIcon` button. If that element isn't present, the
Modal will use the Modal Heading to make sure screen reader users have focus near the start of the
Modal's content. This allows screen reader users to discover the Modal's content more naturally
without having to navigate back up again. Sometimes, it is a better user experience to focus on a
different element. The following example shows how `initialFocusRef` can be used to change which
element receives focus when the modal opens.
